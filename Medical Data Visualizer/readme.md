Medical Data Visualizer

Here we will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas

The dataset includes a range of features related to individuals' health and lifestyle, categorized into objective, examination, and subjective features, along with a target variable. Objective features encompass age (measured in days), height (in centimeters), weight (in kilograms), and gender (represented by categorical codes). Examination features include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol levels (classified as normal, above normal, and well above normal), and glucose levels (similarly categorized). Subjective features cover smoking status, alcohol intake, and physical activity, all represented as binary variables. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, also represented as a binary variable. This diverse set of features helps in understanding various factors that may contribute to cardiovascular health.
